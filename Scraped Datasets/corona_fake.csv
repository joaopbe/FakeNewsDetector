CORONAVIRUS HOAX: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome";"China was long ago set to be the 5G showcase for the world.
Major metro areas and technology hubs like Wuhan were
selected to be official 5G Demonstration Zones. Only such a
high concentration of 5G radio-frequency transmitters and
microwave towers would permit a citywide build-out of the
Internet of Things. 2019 was the year Wuhan, the capital of
Hubei, was “expected to have 10,000 5G base stations by
the end of 2019, said Song Qizhu, head of Hubei Provincial
Communication Administration”.[1] Then the coronavirus hit,
so the whole world was told. What really happened was that
a new variant of the coronavirus was released in Wuhan after
the 5G experimenters saw an epidemic of 5G Syndrome
explode. The 5G guinea pigs were literally dropping like flies
as soon as they flipped the 5G switch. The ERs and urgent care
clinics were overwhelmed. The 5G scientists watching the
burgeoning public health crisis immediately activated Plan B:
Blame it on a virulent flu—a bioengineered coronavirus that
produces symptoms similar to 5G Syndrome.”

5G Syndrome Maps Perfectly with Coronavirus Outbreaks

There’s a LOT of hard evidence now emerging the further away we get from the original crime scene in Wuhan, China and as the coronavirus pops up around the world in 5G Hotspots that indicates this pandemic is being manufactured for multiple reasons.

As it turns out, those nations with the most advanced 5G roll-outs have the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, both infection rates and death rates.

In those countries that have permitted IoT build-outs where the 5G power grids are the most developed, the coronavirus infection rate is taking off.

What’s really interesting is that Africa has thus far shown very few cases. As of this weekend there were only 3 medically acknowledged cases on the entire continent. Which begs the question: How do the Third World countries in Africa avoid such a contagious strain of the coronavirus given the pervasive lack of proper sanitation and necessary hygiene?

In light of how deeply involved the Chinese are with development projects all over Africa, it’s quite curious how that infection number is still so low. Perhaps it’s directly related to the absence of 5G roll-outs in the vast majority of African nations.

Before those nations suffering the greatest number of coronavirus infections to date are further investigated — China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, France, Spain, Kuwait — another curious development ought to be looked at closely.

The Proof is in the Cruise Ships

The single best proof of the quite obvious 5G-Coronavirus linkage are the various cruise ships that have seen an inexplicable mushrooming of coronavirus cases, even after all the passengers were quarantined.

Many of the biggest cruise lines now advertise the fact that they have the latest and greatest 5G technologies in place. The most advanced cruise ships actually possess the best examples of what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in the future … if the build-outs proceed unimpeded by the very serious health concerns and safety issues.

5G Nations

It has also been astutely observed that those nations with the most pervasive and powerful 5G networks fully functioning are those that have suffered the biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus to date. Why should anyone be surprised at this wholly predictable outcome?

The following excerpt comes from: CORONAVIRUS BOMBSHELL: This proves it should be named “5G COVID-19”

The importance of viewing the coronavirus COVID-19 as a “Telephone Disease” is that by doing so it explains some perplexing mysteries about the spread of this disease—such as why this disease has struck the Gulf nations and monarchies in the Persian Gulf region, but becomes explainable when one notices their ongoing 5G revolution—most particularly in Iran, where this country is completely blanketed to its smallest village with 4G technology coverage—but who are now putting the finishing touches on rolling out 5G technology throughout their entire nation in the coming weeks—finishing touches that included Iran activating their Chinese bought 5G technology for testing—that was immediately met by Iran having more coronavirus cases and deaths of any nation outside of China—and whose Vice President is one of seven of their top government officials now infected.

Both 5G Demonstration Zones such as Wuhan, China and floating 5G cruise liners are correctly considered 5G Hotspots. These 5G Hotspots, for the uninitiated, are really KILL ZONES because many folks will die early the longer they bask in those dangerously high levels of 5G radio-frequencies and microwave radiation.

The following excerpt from a previous exposé provides critical links for every individual who lives, works and/or plays in a 5G Super-Hotspots.

Which brings us to the single most perilous aspect of the military deployment of 5G—KILL ZONES.

All the scientific evidence available in the public domain now indicates that wherever 5G infrastructure is located in the greatest concentration generating the most powerful EMFs and microwaves, those 5G Super-Hotspots will effectively function as kill zones. As follows:

5G Super-Hotspots: You better know where the “kill zones” are located!

In order to fully grasp the highly destructive and deadly potential of these rapidly emerging 5G Super-Hotspots, the following video exposé presents a scenario where the most powerful “directed energy weapons” will be located within these 5G kill zones.

Which bring us to the primary purpose of this article—5G Syndrome.

5G Syndrome

5G Syndrome is a relatively new disease that has yet to go mainstream because of how its official recognition would immediately terminate the ongoing 5G roll-out.

Exactly what are the symptoms of 5G Syndrome?

There are many, and they manifest differently in each victim of this insidious disease.

Of course, a good number of typical flu symptoms mimic 5G Syndrome.

But what’s most important is that these two illnesses — Influenza and 5G Syndrome — will mutually sustain each other. In that way, it can be quite confusing to accurately tease out which symptoms are associated with which disease.

In other words, if you have the flu, your exposure to 5G will make it much worse. Likewise, if you have a case of full-blown 5G Syndrome, you will be much more susceptible to getting the flu, and if you do, it will be significantly worse.



Back to the primary symptoms. The best medical reference that we have at this point, since 5G Syndrome is still a relatively new medical phenomenon, is another disease known variously EMF Hypersensitivity Illness and Electrohypersensitivity (EHS).

What follows are just a few of the most common symptoms that are frequently experienced by people who know they have EHS. (Also, see the preceding diagram.)

Nausea, headaches and migraines
Ringing in the ears
Numbness in the face or other body parts
Dry eyes and sight problems
Inability to concentrate and unexplained fatigue
Depression
Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmia
Hyperactivity and insomnia
Redness and rashes
Dryness in the throat and mouth
Swollen sinuses and symptoms rhinitis

There are several other symptoms that are also being recognized as the direct result of intensive EMF and microwave exposures. As follows:

Headaches, migraines
Chronic exhaustion
Inner agitation
Sleeplessness, daytime sleepiness
Tinnitus
Susceptibility to infection
Nervous and connective tissue pains, for which the usual causes do not explain even the most conspicuous symptoms.
(Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century)
KEY POINT: It’s essential to correctly comprehend the difference between 5G Syndrome and 5G flu.  While there are several similarities, it’s the differences that really matter.  Hence, every smartphone user and IoT enthusiast is compelled to contemplate any new health conditions or unusual symptoms or inexplicable sickness, particularly those that have been chronic and/or long term.

Conclusion

The Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has awakened many to the reality of 5G Syndrome.

Perhaps it took all of humanity to get freaked out by a scary frankenvirus — COVID-19 — in order to wake up to this extreme and growing danger in our midst—5G technology and the slowly emerging IoT.

With this crucial understanding, at least now we know what we’re really dealing with. So, the best thing informed people can do is pass the word around: It’s really 5G and your smartphone that is causing the current pandemic, not necessarily the coronavirus or even any of the many other flu bugs circulating around the planet in 2020.

Now many folks will naturally get a bad case of one of the many types of influenzas, or even the coronavirus itself, and they will need to take that illness/disease very seriously. If they are elderly or infirm or suffer from other illnesses, they especially need to follow the best advice out there.  For the sake of prevention, there is this sage advice: Here’s How Everyone Can Avoid Getting The Coronavirus.

For other alternative treatments and holistic approaches, excellent guidance such as this can be followed: Natural Protection Strategy Against Viruses, Including the Coronavirus

Lastly, it’s important to note that the 5G Syndrome angle presented here is only one of several perspectives concerning what is really an ongoing series of bioterrorist attacks being carried out in 5G-intensive zones. The perpetrators are continuing the bio-attacks wherever they must cover up an epidemic of 5G syndrome so that the worldwide military deployment of 5G is not jeopardized by disclosures about the extremely serious health dangers and safety hazards.

Do you see how they do it?!

The NWO globalists are very clever, aren’t they?

Author’s Note

This “CORONAVIRUS HOAX” does not mean there is not a highly contagious bioengineered coronavirus that is being released as a bioweapon in the nations that have experienced the ongoing bioterrorists attacks. It means that these stealthy bio-attacks were meant to cover up the raging epidemics of 5G Syndrome in those specific locations. So, the coronavirus is quite real just as SARS and MERS, Bird Flu and Swine Flu were real. But, the Wuhan coronavirus was specifically bioengineered in order to create and hype a global pandemic around COVID-19. Again, the hoax aspect does not refer to a non-existent coronavirus; that frankenvirus is quite real indeed and being cunningly used as a decoy.

Editor’s Note

It’s of paramount importance to understand that the proven 5G-Coronavirus connection is just one piece of this [ONGOING] series of bioterrorist attacks and 5G assaults, their systematic cover-ups and the subsequent psyops. The 27 exposés posted in the following link flesh out the skeleton of this “staged hoax blended with reality” which ought to be understood by every resident on planet Earth: BIOENGINEERED and 5Ged CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: What Everyone Needs to Know";1
1;NYC Man Drops Dead In Middle Of Street – Suspected Coronavirus! ;"An Asian man wearing a surgical mask passed out yesterday in the middle of a crowded street in Queens. The man was rushed to the hospital, where according to social media reports, he is believed to have died.
The man’s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus.

The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants.
According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving.
As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.
Unfortunately, New York City has been facing a rise in racism against Asian Americans since the outbreak of the coronavirus.";1

Ronaldo doctors and anyone working in the facilities will also pay out of their own pockets to make them hospitals accessible to all as soon as possible, thus helping healthcare in Portugal to cope with this difficult moment.

The world is going through a very difficult moment which demands the utmost care and attention from all of us. I speak to you today not as a football player, but as a son, father, a human being concerned with the latest developments that is affecting the whole world.";1
4;American Airlines will ground about half its fleet next month;"American Airlines is grounding nearly half of its fleet and canceling 55,000 flights next month, according to an internal message sent to employees obtained by CNN. The note did not disclose any furloughs or layoffs, and the airline has declined to comment on whether it is considering such cuts.

The airline also expects “demand to fall even more before it gets better,"" the message stated.

The striking numbers in an internal email from American Airlines President Robert Isom include a reduction of international flights by 75% and domestic flights by 30% in April, “with plans to reduce it even further in May.”

The message said American would park 130 wide body and 320 narrow body planes. The airline has told regulators that its core fleet includes 942 aircraft.

The airline, which is the world's largest, also said it is continuing efforts to reduce the number of employees it pays, by expanding voluntary leave programs and “offering an early out” to employees with at least 15 years of service. The note did not disclose any furloughs or layoffs, and the airline has declined to comment on whether it is considering such cuts.";0

In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!
SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth…drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy…your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly…the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That’s very dangerous.
Pls send and share with family, friends and everyone about this ! Take care everyone n may the world recovers from corona virus soon. May all be well n happy.";1
7;COVID-19 Found in Toilet Paper;"Masks were the first to go. Then, hand sanitizers.
Now, novel coronavirus panic buyers are snatching up … toilet paper?
Retailers in the US and Canada have started limiting the number of toilet paper packs customers can buy in one trip. Some supermarkets in the UK are sold out. Grocery stores in Australia have hired security guards to patrol customers.
But now the coronavirus has been found in the one place people never expected, toilet paper.
An estimated 6000 more people have contracted the virus in the United States tied to a contamination of toilet paper. Testing buy Washington State Health department confirmed the COVID-19 virus particles were present in the samples they took from five separate packages of toilet paper from Big Box stores. The CDC said this strain of deadly virus “breeds rapidly in tissue fibers.”
The CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.
“Use a washcloth to clean yourself after you go to the bathroom, it’s not a big deal, that’s what we did back in the old days,” said Peter Lendl, who headed the investigation of the contaminated toilet paper. “Just know which one is yours.”
State Health departments are asking you to set your toilet paper outside so hazmat workers can come by and dispose of the contaminated items.
“We all need to work together,” said Peter. “We need each other as a community, as a society.”
Stores have been ordered to halt all sales of toilet paper until further notice. Toilet paper factories are being shut down while sanitation measures are being taken.";1
8;Bill Gates Admits “Vaccines Are Best Way To Depopulate;"It is not a new thing that some parents wouldn’t want their children to be vaccinated. They say that it is just wrong to inject their kids with a VIRUS—no matter what state it may be. They perceive it as making their children SICK. Physicians say otherwise as they believe that getting vaccinated will make one’s immune system ‘aware’ of viruses so that when it comes into contact with the body, our white blood cell ‘soldiers’ would know how to defend them. And for years, the doctors have been quite successful in convincing many people of this premise.
But now, a recent study puts to light a not-so-new problem with vaccines. And it is mainly because its adjuvant ‘Aluminum’ may be doing more harm than good.
Chemicals that are commonly used in the production of vaccines, according to the CDC, are done so to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine. Adjuvants like aluminum (one of the most common) are a component of vaccines that potentates the immune response to an antigen. The adjuvant is basically used to invoke the desired immune response.
Aluminum has been added to vaccines for approximately 90 years, and since then, a lot of controversy, especially in recent years, has emerged regarding their safety and effectiveness.
This controversy comes as a result of a number of recent studies (some of which are presented in this article) outlining clear concerns over the use of aluminum in this manner, as well as the fact that over the past few years, billions of dollars have been paid to families with vaccine injured children.
There are a number of reasons why more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children.
This is quite concerning, given the fact that recommended immunization rates have more than doubled in the past few decades. In some developed countries, by the time a child is 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds, along with high amounts of aluminum adjuvants through routine vaccinations.
Here are some eye-opening reasons why so many people are starting to question the safety of administering vaccines that contain aluminum.

9;Trump Could Profit From Coronavirus Testing;"According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website, the CDC has developed a new laboratory test kit for use in testing patient specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC also claims that this test kit is intended for use with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast DX Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS 1.4 software. This test is intended for use with upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from persons who meet CDC criteria for COVID-19 testing.
Applied Biosystems is one of the various brands under the Life Technologies brand of Thermo Fisher Scientific corporation. The brand is focused on integrated systems for genetic analysis, which include computerized machines and the consumables used within them, such as reagents. 
It is safe to say that the need of the federal government to use these devices provided by the Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp. will substantially increase profitability and likely increase the value of stock in the company. 
According to the Associated Press, Donald Trump, the current President of the United States who is supposed to be managing the Coronavirus epidemic and how the testing is conducted, has listed investments in V.F. Corp (VFC) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation (TMO), both of which moved jobs out of the U.S. in high profile outsourcing deals. There is reason to believe that Donald Trump stands to profit from medical testing of coronavirus that will now take place in the United States. 
In 2016, Trump disclosed an 104-page public financial disclosure report, which confirmed that he held investments in companies like Ford Motor Co., Apple Inc. and the parent company of the maker of Oreo cookies. One of Trump’s main talking points during his initial campaign was that as president he would stop the outflow of American jobs. The companies he invested in at the time were subject to scrutiny because Trump was supporting companies that were responsible for major outsourcing. 
Both Fortune Magazine and The New York Post confirmed in May of 2016 that Trump listed investments in V.F. Corp. and Thermo Fisher Scientific. If Trump still maintains these investments, it is a direct conflict of interest to use a company that he stands to profit from to conduct coronavirus testing. 
Additionally, Trump’s transition team announced in Dec. 2016, that Trump had sold all of his stock interests ahead of taking the oath of office, but there was never any proof provided to confirm this statement. When asked on a conference call with reporters whether Trump had investments in Boeing at the time, then spokesman Jason Miller said the president-elect had sold all of his stocks in June of 2016.
According to the Associated Press, his advisers at the time provided no proof of the transactions and would not explain the apparent sell-off. Many of Trump’s financial records are still unknown, including his income tax returns which are still at issue in ongoing litigation. 
In Nov. 2017, a state banquet was held in Trump’s honor during a visit to China, where more than two dozen business titans were in attendance. One of the attendees was Gianluca Pettiti, President for Thermo Fisher Scientific China. The point of the dinner, according to sources, was for the White House to “home in” on companies that could announce “done deals” that would have the effect of chipping away at the U.S. trade deficit with China. But, considering the presence of Thermo Fisher Scientific and Trump’s previous (and possibly ongoing) personal financial relationship with the company, the guest list looks highly suspect. 
Virologists in Berlin produced the first diagnostic test for the Coronavirus a month and a half before the first COVID-19 case not linked to travel was diagnosed in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) began shipping coronavirus testing supplies to nearly 60 countries by February, but Trump didn’t want those kits.
The United States declined to use the WHO test, even temporarily as a bridge until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could produce its own test and the Trump administration has given no explanation as to why. Trump’s possible interest in the company that the U.S. will be using to provide the tests and the fact that if he might still own stock in Thermo Fisher Scientific and world stand to profit from the government contract, could be a major reason why no other tests were accepted. 
At this point, Trump needs to show proof of the sale of his stock in the company just to assure the American public that he did indeed properly divest all of his interests that could be considered a conflict. 
UPDATE: Upon accessing Trump’s financial disclosures for 2018/2019, there is no current investment in Thermo Fisher Scientific listed. There are however still some concerning issues; this report only covers disclosures up to May 19, 2019, so any new acquisitions would not be listed. Moreover, there are still trust accounts listed, such as DJT Holdings, that do not detail the nature of the holdings and specify “entity's other holdings and assets are reported elsewhere” in the listing.
Considering that it was confirmed that Trump did previously own stock in this company and that the Thermo Fisher Scientific president of the China division was a special CEO guest at a state dinner for Trump in China, it is difficult to say what his business relationship continues to be with the company that is receiving this huge government contract or what direct benefit Trump might be deriving from any continued relationship. We also do not have the disclosures of his children and any other relatives and what stock they are specifically invested in and if they stand to benefit personally. 
Stay tuned, I am still digging…";1
10;CORONA UNMASKED: Chinese Intelligence Officer Reveals True Magnitude of China’s Fake “Coronavirus” Crisis;"I am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the “corona virus” outbreak.  It is far worse than the media are telling you.
 
I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies — or perhaps occupied — a high-ranking position in military intelligence.  I am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified information and I have been involved in many top secret government projects.  I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.
I have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government.  It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.
It will not surprise you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in grave danger, as would those of my wife and son.  I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would make it easy to identify me.
By now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply “coronavirus”. You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal — most likely a bat or a pangolin — that was sold in a wild animal market.  You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.
Finally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system.  The official lethality rate is approximately  2% or so.
All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.
Let me start by telling you that the world does not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to certain limited areas.
In most ways, the two countries are more interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing countries from gaining more power.  They also have a shared interest in keeping real power out of the hands of their “ordinary” citizens. To this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the overwhelming majority of their media outlets.  The Americans in particular have perfected the art of creating made-up “divisions” between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that both serve the same masters.
 
These same nations also posses technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is kept carefully hidden from public view.  This includes advanced artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election in the world; biological and chemical agents( 生化剂) that can manipulate and control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will not go into now.
*******
My point is that the great nations do not compete so much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true workings of the world from the “uninitiated” public.
Let me return to the virus.
Last year, large-scale anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong.
The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party considered these to be a grave threat to the integrity and stability of the motherland.  The U.S. government and the EU both knew that the Chinese were secretly working on a biological agent that was supposed to make the protesters docile and obedient.  Without going into detail, I worked on that project.  We tried to develop a sort of spray that could be dispersed from helicopters or drones and that would lead to mental retardation and behavioural change.
Naturally, as Hong Kong is one of the most open and international cities in the world, the Party decided that it was too risky to release the agent in Hong Kong without first testing it.  For this, it needed a great number of human guinea pigs. Two groups were identified for this.
First, we rounded up a large number of so-called “islamic radicals” in Xinjiang Province and took them to what we called “training camps.”
We had already been using these camps for human experimentation for several years, but the Hong Kong protests meant that we redoubled our efforts.  We exposed the inmates to various “alpha” experimental agents.  As these were odourless and invisible, the subjects were not aware that they were taking part in medical trials.
The resulting high rates of cancer, premature dementia, suicidal depression and death by organ failure could easily be suppressed, as the camps are located in very remote parts of our motherland.
Once the initial experiments had yielded a “beta” agent, it was transported to Hubei Province, where it was deployed in a special military testing facility outside the city of Wuhan.  This was not even a particularly well-kept secret: the existence of this facility has been reported in international news.  Even the fact that it is located close to the wild animal market is a known fact.
By then our President had already introduced a “social credit” system that allowed us to identify disloyal, counter-revolutionary and bourgeois elements in our society.  Using the social credit scores — which are taken from online activity, electronic shopping behaviour and reports from informers in civil society — we selected some of the worst offenders.  These included human rights lawyers and activists, Christians, homosexuals, artists, intellectuals, people who speak foreign languages, and other undesirables.
Once these troublemakers had been collected and placed in the testing facility, we exposed them to the Agent, which is biochemical in nature and spread in an invisible aerosol, akin to certain viruses.  Initial results were encouraging, as we saw significant cognitive decline and reduction in higher mental processing facilities.  Essentially, our undesirables were becoming mildly mentally disabled, which is precisely the effect we wanted to produce in order to pacify the restive population of Hong Kong.

11;Monaco’s Head of State Prince Albert II Contracts Coronavirus;"he palace of Monaco says its ruler, Prince Albert II, has tested positive for the new coronavirus but his health is not worrying.

Albert, 62, appeared to be the first head of state who has publicly said he contracted the virus.

In a statement Thursday, the palace said he is being treated by doctors from the Princess Grace Hospital, named after his U.S. actress mother. It says Albert is continuing to work from his home office in the palace and is in constant contact with members of his government.

In the statement, Albert urged residents of his tiny Mediterranean principality to respect confinement measures.

Albert is the second child of Princess Grace — formerly Grace Kelly — and Prince Rainier of Monaco. Albert became a five-time Olympic bobsledder and in recent years has been a global environmental campaigner.

Fluent in English and French, Albert graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts with a degree in political science in 1981, and is a member of the International Olympic Committee.

12;China recasts itself as global coronavirus response leader as US, Europe struggle;"In a matter of weeks, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Communist Party have apparently managed to convince the world to forget that they muzzled the coronavirus for months as it grew into what is now a global pandemic, silencing doctors and critics whose early alarms could have saved thousands of lives. Instead, the communist-run nation has now positioned itself as the country ahead of the coronavirus curve, even as they make unsubstantiated claims that the U.S. is behind the crisis.

From denying its central role in unleashing the pandemic to baseless finger-pointing and finally, to casting itself as a global savior, China's makeover has been aided by a compliant media and allies such as Russia and Iran who are eager to help deflect the blame to the U.S.
""Two narrative tracks that we’re seeing advanced by China is malign information trying to finger the U.S. as the origin of the coronavirus, and then the second narrative track is what we call ‘Brand China,’ which is the [Chinese government’s] effort to try and turn the crisis into a news story about the supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party as opposed to democratic systems that have allegedly mishandled the crisis,” U.S. Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle told The Washington Times. “So [it’s] basically a 'China' good, everyone else bad’ narrative.”
Indeed, China has been mounting a very public -- and largely successful -- humanitarian campaign to come across as a strong world leader. It's a power move that has allowed China to take over a role the United States and Europe have dominated for decades.
China's private and public sectors are working in lockstep to fast-track aid to countries that are in desperate need of it.
""The Chinese government has been trying to project Chinese state power beyond its borders and establish China as a global leader, not dissimilar to what the U.S. government has been doing for the better part of a century, and the distribution of medical aid is part of that mission,"" Dr. Yangyang Cheng, a postdoctoral research associate at Cornell University, told The Intercept.
Earlier this week, Xi pledged to send more medical experts to Italy, a country on track to surpass China in the number of coronavirus-related deaths when the numbers are tallied at the end of Thursday.
China has already sent 2,000 rapid diagnostic tests to the Philippines as well as aid to Japan and Iraq.
Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, co-founder of the Alibaba Group, has sent supplies and doctors to Iran, Iraq, Spain, France and Belgium. Ma said he will also donate masks, test kits and protective suits to every single African country battling the disease. Specifically, his foundation has pledged to donate 1.1 million testing kits, six million masks and 60,000 protective suits and face shields.
On Thursday, he tweeted: ""We join hands with Asian neighbors to fight Covid-19! We and Alibaba Foundation will donate 2 million masks, 150k test kits, 20k protective suits and 20k face shields to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. More help to other Asian nations is on the way! Go Asia!""

Earlier this week, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic pleaded for China's help during a televised address.
""European solidarity does not exist,"" Vucic said. ""That was a fairy tale on paper. I believe in my brother and friend Xi Jinping, and I believe in Chinese help.""
Despite the slam, Serbia is currently applying to become a member of the European Union.
China's bold international steps are in marked contrast to its initial response. The country has been accused of coverups and data manipulation that some argue make China at least partially responsible for the global pandemic that's led to more than 9,000 deaths.
A study by the University of Southampton in the U.K. published earlier this month, cited by Axios earlier this week, concluded that if Chinese authorities had acted accordingly three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by as much as 95 percent and its spread across the world limited. Even acting one week earlier would have reduced the number by 66 percent.
""They made some blunderous mistakes in the early six or seven weeks, and then they came down hard with a gargantuan quarantine,"" said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Now, he said, China is suppressing ""whatever additional dissident thoughts there may be on exactly what's going on.""

In recent days, Chinese officials have tried to turn the tables and claim America is the country to blame for the virus -- an accusation that did not sit well with President Trump, who has gone out of his way to call COVID-19 the ""China Virus"" or the ""Wuhan Virus"" despite demands from China to stop.
On Wednesday, Trump defended linking the virus to China.
""It's not racist at all,"" he said during a press conference.""No, not at all. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""
While the pandemic is just one in a series of irritants that have strained the relationship between China and the United States in the past three years, China shifting the blame to the United States has infuriated the Trump administration so much that it has been working overtime to combat Beijing's unproven claims.

13;Queen Urges Britons to Focus on ‘Common Goal’ as Virus Spreads;"Queen Elizabeth II urged people to adapt their lifestyles and work together to protect the most vulnerable as the U.K. accelerated its efforts to tackle the deepening coronavirus crisis.
The 93-year-old monarch said Britain’s history is “forged by people and communities coming together to work as one” and it has succeeded when people unite in pursuit of a common goal.
She and her husband, Prince Philip, traveled to Windsor Castle, to the west of London, on Thursday, according to the statement.

“We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services,” she said. “But now, more than any time in our recent past, we all have a vitally important part to play as individuals -- today and in the coming days, weeks and months.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is considering tougher action to fight the spread of the coronavirus in London, the epicenter of the U.K. outbreak, though it denied it plans to ban people from leaving their homes or the city. Bars, restaurants and shops are expected to close in an effort to contain the outbreak, which has taken at least 104 lives in the U.K..
“Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,” the queen said. “I am certain we are up to that challenge. You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part.”

14;Boris Johnson: UK can turn tide of coronavirus in 12 weeks;"Boris Johnson has raised the prospect of mass testing for coronavirus and and social distancing allowing the UK to return to some form of normality by the summer, while stressing that tougher measures such as locking down cities remained a possibility.
The next 12 weeks could “turn the tide of this disease”, Johnson told the daily Downing Street press conference on the pandemic, saying it was possible to “send coronavirus packing in this country, but only if we all take the steps we have outlined”.
Flanked by his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, Johnson did not announce any new measures to keep people separated and slow the spread of the virus, such as a much reported plan to severely restrict movement in London, the UK epicentre of the outbreak.
“We’re guided very much by the science and whether we think the advice we have given is working,” Johnson said, when asked whether new restrictions could be introduced. But, he added, if current measures were not working, “nothing is ruled out”.
Striking a notably, if cautiously, optimistic note, Johnson said: “I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I’m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. But only if we all take the steps that we’ve outlined – that is vital.”
The PM based his assessment on experimental treatments for the virus, saying the first UK patients had that day been part of a randomised test for one drug, and also the possibly rapid rollout of an antibody test “as simple as a pregnancy test”, which could determine if someone has had the Covid-19 virus.
“That knowledge of where the virus is will make a huge difference to our management of the disease and our ability to reduce disruption and economic difficulty,” Johnson said, saying hundreds of thousands of the tests could be bought.
Johnson did stress the test had not yet been proven. Whitty also urged some caution, warning that while an antibody test looked possible, it remained to be seen whether the ones being offered now worked well enough.
The PM was at pains to dispel rumours of imminent and robust new measures in London, such as forcing bars and pubs to close, and limiting movement – but warned that people needed to abide by social distancing rules, saying adherence was “very patchy” in some parts of the capital.
“There is no prospect of us wanting to stop public transport in London or stop the tube or the buses,” he said. “We are going to want people to avoid gatherings where they transmit the disease. If it becomes necessary to do more to ensure that, we will certainly do so.”
But in one politically striking answer, Johnson said the economic response to the pandemic would be “different from 2008”, saying that, after the banking crash, ordinary workers had not been assisted in the way the banks were. The mantra would be “looking after the people first”, Johnson said.
Asked about hospital capacity, especially in London, Whitty said intensive and respiratory care would be “first point of pressure”, and that even with proper social distancing, patient numbers would rise for the next two weeks.
Whitty said it was up to people to abide by guidance: “There’s a lot of evidence a huge proportion of people are – we don’t know if it will be enough.”
Other priorities, he said, would be to test more NHS staff for the virus, and to roll out more protective equipment for them.";0
15;US state department warns against all Americans leaving country amid pandemic;"The State Department’s Level 4 advisory on all international travel comes a week after the government issued a Level 3 advisory, which urged Americans to reconsider their travel plans.

A number of Americans are already trying to get back home from countries like Guatemala, which has implemented harsh restrictions on flights going into and out of the country.

The latest advisory will likely cause more anxiety for Americans currently traveling abroad.

“If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe,” the latest advisory reads.";0
16;Interest rates cut to their lowest on record to fight coronavirus crisis;"The Bank of England has cut interest rates to their lowest level on record and launched £200 billion more quantitative easing to rescue the economy as the coronavirus crisis continues to rock financial markets.

In its second emergency intervention in little over a week, the Bank cut rates from 0.25 per cent to 0.1 per cent and pledged to buy £200 billion more gilts and corporate bonds to prop up growth, taking its total QE programme to £645 billion.

The action was taken after a serious deterioration in the gilt market as investors have sold out of UK government debt to switch into short-term cash holdings, largely in dollars. With the economy effectively in suspended animation, investors are liquidating their positions and scrambling for the

17;Jay Inslee Urges the Trump Administration to Treat the Coronavirus Response Like a War;"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose state has been among the hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, is urging the federal government to mount a wartime-style push to manufacture the equipment needed to curb the spread of COVID-19.
“This is one place the federal government could be very useful,” the Democratic governor told TIME in a phone interview Wednesday, urging the Trump Administration to mobilize to “enhance the manufacturing supply chain like happened in World War II. I think the federal government should do that immediately to expand the manufacturing capacity.”
Washington, the first state to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19, has more than 1,100 confirmed cases and more than 65 deaths caused by the virus as of Wednesday, according to the Washington State Department of Health. Inslee has declared a state of emergency, ordered schools shut statewide for six weeks and imposed a two-week closure of restaurants, bars and other recreational gathering spots, among the dramatic measures the state has taken to try to slow the spread of the virus. The governor, aware of how precarious the situation is from first-hand experience managing the outbreak, is worried about shortages in supplies, from ventilators to Personal Protective Equipment.
“It would be very helpful if the federal government could use its enormous levers, both statutory and economic, to try to increase the supply chain and bring new manufacturers to make some of these products that maybe have never made them before, but we really need them to make them now,” Inslee says.
Already there are reports of businesses looking to shift production to materials in demand due to the virus. Minnesota’s StarTribune, for example, reported that a Duluth, Minn., distillery is making hand sanitizer and giving it out for free. The Detroit News reported that some of Detroit’s automakers are looking into whether they could produce medical equipment like ventilators.
Inslee says Washington is considering “creative ways” to manufacture equipment, like prison industries manufacturing masks. “That’s not a done deal yet, but it’s something we’re exploring,” he adds. But though the state is looking at every potential avenue, Inslee insisted a federal response is necessary, given its ability in scale and scope to mobilize national industries.
Expanding mobilization could quickly become relevant to the rest of the country: Medical experts throughout the U.S. worry that if the rate of new cases is not slowed and stays on track with Italy’s exponential growth, the entire American health care infrastructure will be overrun.
“We are going to have enormous challenges in our medical system, and we are being as aggressive as possible creating new surge capacity in our hospitals,” Inslee says. “The biggest challenge is personnel, to have enough medical personnel on hand. So we’re bringing in retirees and people who are ready to go, potentially, from other states. And we are asking for military assistance.”
Inslee had praise for some of the federal officials leading the response to the pandemic, including Vice President Mike Pence, and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But he described frustration with the Trump Administration’s initial response.
“Obviously it was more than frustrating that for what seemed like an enormous length of time, we weren’t getting information shared right from the White House,” Inslee says. “It could have been very, very helpful. But we are not dwelling on the past, we have to be really focused on what we can do today, and so I’m focused on going forward and not dwelling on that unfortunate lost time and opportunities for the White House.”
At one point, the relationship between the President and Inslee was so strained that they were trading public barbs. Inslee, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination with climate change as his top issue, criticized the Trump Administration’s handling of information. “I told [Pence] our work would be more successful if the Trump Administration stuck to the science and told the truth,” Inslee tweeted. 
In response, Trump, who downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak for months, called Inslee a “snake.” 
Asked if he thought the state and federal responses were unified now, Inslee responded: “Well we have good working relationships with millions of people in the federal government. It’s just one federal employee that’s created real frustrations.”

18;The First U.S. Company Has Announced an Upcoming Home COVID-19 Test;"Everlywell, a home testing company that offers dozens of lab tests to consumers, is adding a COVID-19 test beginning on March 23.
Given the slow roll out of testing for COVID-19 in the U.S., and concerns about spreading the disease, at-home testing could help to diagnose more cases. After initially limiting testing to one provided by the Centers for Disease Control and conducted at state and local public health labs, the Food and Drug Administration allowed certified labs, including commercial lab testing companies, to develop and distribute COVID-19 tests on Feb. 29. Though other private companies have been involved with creating tests for COVID-19, this is the first company to offer its test directly to consumers.
The Austin-based Everlywell offers a range of validated tests for everything from cholesterol levels to fertility and infectious diseases like STDs.

People can order the Everlywell COVID-19 test on the company’s website, after first answering questions about their basic health, symptoms and risk factors for the coronavirus disease. A doctor still needs to prescribe the test, so telemedicine doctors from PWNHealth, a national network of physicians who prescribe diagnostic tests, then reviews these answers to determine if a person qualifies for testing, based on criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, because COVID-19 tests are not plentiful in the U.S., doctors are trying to rule out other respiratory diseases like flu first, and only ordering tests for people with symptoms who also have other risk factors for infection, such as being in close contact with others who have been diagnosed.
If the telemedicine doctor decides to prescribe an Everlywell COVID-19 test, the company says it will send the $135 test kit in two days (customers can pay $30 more to receive the kit overnight). The kit comes with a special swab that is long enough to take samples from the back of the nose and throat area, along with instructions for how to seal the swab sample to send it back to the company. People can also provide both spit and sputum samples as backups. (For now, the Food and Drug Administration only validates samples from nasoparyngeal swabs, but companies have applied to test spit and sputum.).
The sample is sent in a pre-paid overnight package, and processed at one of several labs approved by the FDA to perform the test around the country within 72 hours. As with many of the commercially available tests, this one extracts SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, from the sample and then probes for specific genetic signatures of the virus.
Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.
The company says it will then send results by text and email, and doctors may advise people to self-isolate until they receive them. If the test is positive, the company also provides a full telemedicine consultation with one of around 200 physicians that is included in the cost of the test. That physician also reports the result as a positive case to the appropriate state health departments, as is required by health authorities.
Everlywell says it is ready to ship 30,000 COVID-19 tests, and plans to expand the number of labs processing the samples. But CEO and founder Julia Cheek says that scaling up the number of testing kits will depend on the availability of swabs for collecting samples. Three major manufacturers make the swabs, but the main producer, it turns out, is a company based in Italy. Because the country is under lockdown, limited supplies from there, as well as the surge in demand as more COVID-19 testing is conducted around the world, are leading to a global shortage of swabs for any lab performing the test. That’s why Everlywell’s first kits will contain only one swab, and Everlywell will limit kits to one per household until the supply of swabs becomes more plentiful.

“We’re working hard to ramp up weekly capacity to test 250,000 Americans,” says Cheek. “Our goal is to continue to refresh capacity but with the global swab shortage we don’t have a confirmed timeline for that yet. Ultimately, she says, the testing kits could be designed for a household so everyone in a family could be tested if needed to know what protective measure they might need to take.

19;Trump Signs Law to Grant Paid Leave Benefits Amid Coronavirus Crisis—But Millions Won’t Be Eligible;"Public health officials have simple advice to abate the spread of COVID-19in the United States: If you’re sick, stay home. And even if you’re not sick, stay home and practice “social distancing” whenever possible.
That could be challenging for the 24% of American civilian workers who lack any sort of paid sick leave. If they skip work because they’re feeling ill or because their children’s schools have closed as a result of coronavirus, they miss paychecks. If they go to work sick, they risk spreading coronavirus to their coworkers and customers.
So as confirmed COVID-19 cases surged from Seattle to New York City, House Democrats attempted to pass legislation that would have provided full-time employees with seven paid sick days on a permanent basis, and 14 additional paid sick days to be used during the duration of the current public health emergency.
They came up short. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin held marathon talks about the contents of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, but multiple House aides previously told TIME that the paid sick leave provisions were a sticking point. Early Saturday, the House passed a version of the bill that includes some temporary paid sick leave provisions, but also includes exemptions that will disqualify millions of Americans. The Senate subsequently passed the amended legislation on Wednesday, and President Donald Trump signed the bill into law hours later.
If you work for the government, or for a company with fewer than 500 employees, you will be eligible for two weeks of sick leave at your regular pay rate to either quarantine, or to seek a COVID-19 diagnosis or preventive care for yourself.

You will also be eligible for two weeks of paid sick leave at no less than two-thirds your regular pay rate if you are caring for a family member with a COVID-19 diagnosis, or to care for a child whose school or daycare has closed as a result of coronavirus concerns.
Full-time employees will be entitled to 80 hours worth of paid sick time. Part-time employees will be entitled to the number of hours they normally work in a two-week period.
Additionally, an expanded Family and Medical Leave Act will provide government employees and those who have worked for companies with fewer than 500 employees for at least 30 days with 10 weeks of emergency paid leave to care for children whose schools or daycare facilities were closed.
Quarantined workers, or those who were caring for afflicted family members, will not be eligible. Healthcare providers and other first responders can also be excluded. After 10 days of unpaid leave, your employer will pay you no less than two-thirds of your usual pay—up to $200 per day, and $10,000 in total.
The legislation stipulates that the Department of Labor can exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees from providing workers with paid emergency leave “when the imposition of such requirements would jeopardize the viability of the business.” About 12 million private sector employees work for companies with fewer than 50 employees.
Companies with more than 500 employees are also excluded from the paid leave mandate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported about 59 million peopleworked for companies with more than 500 employees in 2019—approximately 6.5 million of those people did not have access to paid sick leave.
In light of COVID-19 concerns, however, some large companies have decided to provide paid leave on their own in recent weeks.
Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S. and which already had a paid sick leave policy, has expanded its policies in light of the global health crisis. Employees working in Walmart stores, offices or distribution centers that are part of mandated quarantines—whether imposed by the government or Walmart—will now receive up to two weeks of pay. Any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 will also receive up to two weeks of pay, according to a press release the company released March 10. Darden Restaurants, which owns the large chain restaurants Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, recently announced it would offer its employees one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked.
Companies with less than 500 employees will have to front the costs of paid sick and emergency leave, but will later be eligible for reimbursement tax credits from the government. For paid sick leave wages provided to employees who must quarantine because they are sick with COVID-19 or are trying to obtain a diagnosis, companies will be reimbursed up to $511 per employee per day. For paid sick leave wages provided to employees caring for loved ones, employers will be reimbursed up to $200 per worker per day. Self-employed individuals are also eligible for the reimbursable tax credits.
Though the original version of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a permanent paid sick leave benefit that would have enabled workers to accrue seven days worth of paid sick leave, the sick leave benefits included in bill that passed the House and Senate will only last through December 31, 2020.
Paid Leave For All Director Dawn Huckelbridge says she’s disappointed more workers aren’t eligible for the benefits, but still sees it as a positive first step toward more inclusive paid leave legislation.
“Obviously it’s not everything, and there’s more that we can and that we must do,” Huckelbridge says. “We do know that this bill does leave out millions, but it does still cover millions. And every day that workers aren’t able to stay home, we’re losing time and we’re losing lives.”
President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on Wednesday night, and the paid leave provisions are supposed to take effect within 15 days.
Trump’s signature was not exactly a surprise. People close to the White House told TIME that Trump’s daughter and senior advisor, Ivanka Trump, was on every call with Secretary Mnuchin and the President that was related to the paid leave aspects of the legislation. She was also in constant communication with Mnuchin during the negotiation process with the House, the sources say.
As the sick and death counts continue to rise, Huckelbridge urges Trump and Congress to keep going. “I think that there is an urgent need to pass this bill, and there is an urgent need to keep building on it,” she says, “so we’re not caught flat footed for the next crisis.”

20;The NY Times exposes real reason behind coronavirus hype: Crash the market to harm Trump’s reelection chances;"For Americans who see the Democrat Left behind the over-hyped media coverage and societal reactions to the coronavirus ‘pandemic,’ The New York Times, God bless ’em, just proved those suspicions correct.
And wouldn’t you know it, the strategy is a familiar one: Use a manufactured crisis to get rid of President Donald Trump.
Oh, true, coronavirus is real enough, But given it’s so-far minuscule infection rate in the U.S. (1,600 or so), death rate (~40), and the fact that more than half of patients infected by the disease globally have already recovered, there is no reason to shutter professional sports seasons or declare states of emergency when you have a single case of the virus in your state. Why? Think November 2020.
Under the headline, “Trump’s Re-election Chances Suddenly Look Shakier,” the Times reports:
President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers’ two major assumptions for the campaign — a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left — quickly evaporating.
After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.
And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.
“Biden’s success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,” said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. “His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.”
Said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, to the Times — and this is telling: “If it was Warren or Bernie and you don’t have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by. But if it’s Biden, ‘My I.R.A. has tanked,’ and we’re going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it’s a totally different story.”
The Times concedes:
Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.
And if there’s any constant in the Trump era, it is that what’s in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden’s decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.
Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.
There is no way Joe “Gaffe” Biden has a shot in Hades against Trump this fall unless certain economic and social conditions occur. Or are exploited thanks to the timely occurrence of events.
We didn’t figure it would be long before the real intention behind all the sports cancellations, states of emergencies declared by Democratic governors, and outsized Democratic congressional responses to a so-far limited viral outbreak — not to mention the asinine tanking of the stock market — were revealed.
And the Times didn’t let us down.
Consider — and this should anger every single American who has their retirement savings wrapped up in investment vehicles and 401(k) accounts: The Democratic Left is proving beyond any doubt they are willing to burn down your savings and your future just to get a short-term political victory.
We have words for people like that but we won’t publish them.";1
